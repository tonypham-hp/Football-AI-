# ⚽ Football AI – YOLOv8 Detection Project

This repository contains the **Football AI project**, which focuses on detecting **players, referees, and balls**, as well as identifying **pitch keypoints** using **YOLOv8**.  
The project was trained and deployed using **Google Colab**, **Kaggle GPUs**, and **Roboflow** integration.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This AI system aims to analyze football videos by:
- Detecting **players**, **referees**, and **balls** in the field.
- Extracting **pitch keypoints** for camera calibration and tactical visualization.
- Enabling future tasks like player tracking, team formation analysis, and event detection.
